## Advanced Customization

For advanced customization the following highlighted fields need to be set.

There are three different icon customizations. Color, Icon, and URLs.

The "Key Field" is the field which will be used to determine what icon/color/ or url to use when the row's data corresponds with the key value. You can define the key value pairs by clicking define options.

#### Icon
The icon customization type uses [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com). You can find the correct icon name by looking at this [link](https://remixicon.com) or utilizing Budibase's icon picker.

Be sure to spell the name correctly with the "ri" prefix.

Here's an example of it working.

#### Color
<br/>
The color customization type uses standard RGB HTML Codes. Be sure to prefix it with a "#". You may also use Budibase's spectrum colors as well var(--spectrum-global-color-static-green-400) in this format. The color advanced customization will use the default marker set 

Here's an example of it working.

#### URL
The url customization type uses standard urls but be aware some URLs might cause issues due to CORS. Instead it's preferred to (host the images within budibase itself)[https://docs.budibase.com/docs/image]. You can also use base 64 images if that's easier for you!

Here's an example of it working.

# Known Issues
- The control layer functionality does not fully work within the builder. It will work when the application is published.
